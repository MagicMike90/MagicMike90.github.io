This has the effect of spreading the importance of that feature across all of the bninary features and can often makes each feature appear to be <em>umimportant</em> even when the original nominal categorical feature is highly imprtant</li>\n<li>If two features are highly correlated then one feature will claim much of the importance, making the other feature appear to be far less important, which has implications for interpretation if not considerred.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Feature Engineering Notes!","date":"January 31, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"machine-learning-feature-engineering","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"machine-learning-ensemble-learning"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ensemble learning Notes!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"machine-learning-data-prepocessing"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Prepocessing Notes!"}}}}}
