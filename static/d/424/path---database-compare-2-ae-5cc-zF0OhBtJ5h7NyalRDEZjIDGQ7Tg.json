The most common use cases for MongoDB include Single View, Internet of Things, Mobile, Real-Time Analytics, Personalization, Catalog, and Content Management.</p>\n<h2>When would MySQL be a better fit?</h2>\n<p>While most modern applications require a flexible, scalable system like MongoDB, there are use cases for which a relational database like MySQL would be better suited. Applications that require complex, multi-row transactions (e.g., a double-entry bookkeeping system) would be good examples. MongoDB is not a drop-in replacement for legacy applications built around the relational data model and SQL.</p>\n<p>A concrete example would be the booking engine behind a travel reservation system, which also typically involves complex transactions.
