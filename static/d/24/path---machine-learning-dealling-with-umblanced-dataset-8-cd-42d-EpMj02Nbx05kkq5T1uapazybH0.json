They tend to only predict the majority class data. The featueres of minority class are treated as noise and are often ignored. Thus, there is a high probability of misclassification of the nimority class as compared to the majority class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Random under-sampling</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advantages: It can help improve run time and storage problems by reducing the number of training data samples when the traing data set is huge.</li>\n<li>Disadvantages</li>\n<li>It can discard potentially useful information which could be important for building rule classifiers.</li>\n<li>The sample chosen by random under sampling may be a biased sample.
