This makes it useful to one or two app clients because it is niche a service. RPC endpoints can implement business logic inside the service, given that it only does one thing. This adds simplicity and clarity to the service.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"http\"><pre class=\"language-http\"><code class=\"language-http\">GET /someoperation?data=anId\n\nPOST /anotheroperation\n{\n  \"data\":\"anId\";\n  \"anotherdata\":\"another value\"\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>For a REST (<strong>resource-based</strong>) endpoint, you must treat it like a resource that provides domain data. The reward is you are now segregating data into separate domains. This makes it useful for when you have any number of apps requesting data. This approach attempts to decouple data from application or business logic.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"http\"><pre class=\"language-http\"><code class=\"language-http\">GET /someresources/anId\n\nPUT /someresources/anId\n{\"anotherdata\":\"another value\"</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes for API engineering!","date":"January 21, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"api","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"angular"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Angular Notes!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"machine-learning-training-algorithms"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Training Algorithms of machine learning!"}}}}
